Welcome to the Wikipedia Game code project.  
The Wikipedia Game is the working title of an interactive new editor tutorial for Wikipedia.  
We're brainstorming several ideas right now and want to draft a clear plan for the coding approach.  

It may include:
* Mediawiki
* Mediawiki API
* Mediawiki extensions
* PHP
* Javascript
* Flash
* HTML 5

The idea is to create a web-based experience, like an interactive tour in a realistic Wikipedia environment.
It should emulate or run mediawiki with the Vector skin.

The environment can be closed but must have some working links and allow  editable on mock articles.  
The majority of the game is just sequential dialogue boxes, but there are some interactive components:
  text choices, warnings, a reg-ex bad words filter, etc.

The game should be clean, simple, fun, realistic, and enjoyable to play.  
There are 12 levels and each one should take about 5-10 minutes to play resulting in 1-2 hours of gameplay.

Modules which require more involved coding include:
* mock account registration
* dialogue choices
* article editing
* real-time user notices (i.e. new messages)

This game will be fully open sourced and released to the Wikipedia community.  
The license under a free use, reuse, modification, and commercial adaptation license.  Attribution would be nice.
